/* Filesystem.

   For the purposes of the "user processes" and "virtual memory"
   assignments (projects 2 and 3), please treat all the code in
   the filesys directory as a black box.  No changes should be
   needed.  For those projects, a single lock external to the
   filesystem code suffices.

   The filesystem consists of a set of files.  Each file has a
   header called an `index node' or `inode', represented by
   struct inode, that is stored by itself in a single sector (see
   inode.h).  The header contains the file's length in bytes and
   an array that lists the sector numbers for the file's
   contents.

   Two files are special.  The first special file is the free
   map, whose inode is always stored in sector 0
   (FREE_MAP_SECTOR).  The free map stores a bitmap (see
   lib/bitmap.h) that contains one bit for each sector on the
   disk.  Each bit that corresponds to a sector within a file is
   set to true, and the other bits, which are not part of any
   file, are set to false.

   The second special file is the root directory, whose inode is
   always stored in sector 1 (ROOT_DIR_SECTOR).  The root
   directory file stores an array of `struct dir_entry' (see
   directory.h), each of which, if it is in use, associates a
   filename with the sector of the file's inode.

   The filesystem implemented here has the following limitations:

     - No synchronization.  Concurrent accesses will interfere
       with one another, so external synchronization is needed.

     - File size is fixed at creation time.  Because the root
       directory is represented as a file, the number of files
       that may be created is also limited.

     - File data is allocated as a single extent, so that
       external fragmentation can become a serious problem as a
       file system is used over time.

     - No subdirectories.

     - Filenames limited to 14 characters.

     - A system crash mid-operation may corrupt the disk in a way
       that cannot be repaired automatically.  No `fsck' tool is
       provided in any case.

   However one important feature is included:

     - Unix-like semantics for filesys_remove() are implemented.
       That is, if a file is open when it is removed, its blocks
       are not deallocated and it may still be accessed by the
       threads that have it open until the last one closes it. */
