/* Page allocator.  Hands out memory in page-size chunks.
   See malloc.h for an allocator that hands out smaller
   chunks.

   System memory is divided into two "pools" called the kernel
   and user pools.  The user pool is for user (virtual) memory
   pages, the kernel pool for everything else.  The idea here is
   that the kernel needs to have memory for its own operations
   even if user processes are swapping like mad.

   By default, half of system RAM is given to the kernel pool and
   half to the user pool.  That should be huge overkill for the
   kernel pool, but that's just fine for demonstration purposes.

   Within each pool, we simply use a linked list of free pages.
   It would be straightforward to add all available memory to
   this free list at initialization time.  In practice, though,
   that's really slow because it causes the emulator we're
   running under to have to fault in every page of memory.  So
   instead we only add pages to the free list as needed. */
