If you want to be able to give input to Pintos running in Bochs
through a terminal (as opposed to a VGA console window), you will need
to compile squish-pty (with `make') and install it in PATH.
Otherwise, squish-pty is unneeded.

If your version of Perl predates 5.8.0 and you want the "pintos"
script's timeout support (with -T) to properly limit the child's CPU
time, then you will need to compile setitimer-helper (with `make') and
install it in PATH.  Otherwise, setitimer-helper is unneeded.
