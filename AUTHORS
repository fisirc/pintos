* The structure and form of this operating system is inspired by the
  Nachos system from the University of California, Berkeley.  A few of
  the source files are more-or-less literal translations of the Nachos
  C++ code into C.  These files bear the original UCB license notice.

* Some of the source code is derived from code used in the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology's 6.828 advanced operating
  systems course.  These files bear the original MIT license notice.

* All other code written by Ben Pfaff <blp@cs.stanford.edu>.
