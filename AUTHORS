* The structure and form of this operating system is inspired by the
  Nachos system from the University of California, Berkeley.  A few of
  the source files are more-or-less literal translations of the Nachos
  C++ code into C.  These files bear the original UCB license notice.

* Some of the source code is derived from code used in the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology's 6.828 advanced operating
  systems course.  These files bear the original MIT license notice.

* All other code written by Ben Pfaff <blp@cs.stanford.edu>.

* The projects are derived from those designed for Nachos by current
  and former CS140 teaching assistants at Stanford University,
  including at least the following people: Yu Ping
  <yph@cs.stanford.edu>, Greg Hutchins, Kelly Shaw <kashaw (at)
  cs.stanford.edu>, Paul Twohey <twohey AT cs DOT stanford DOT edu>,
  Sameer Qureshi <squreshi@cs.stanford.edu>, John Rector.  (If you're
  not on this list but should be, please let me know.)

* The section on multilevel feedback schedulers in the threads project
  is adapted from a handout written by Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau
  <"dusseau" at the server cs.wisc.edu>.

* Updates for Pintos by Ben Pfaff <blp@cs.stanford.edu>.
