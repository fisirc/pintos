CORRECTNESS [[total]]
---------------------

Small files (< 63 kB)
  sm-create: create small file, verify initialization to zeros
  sm-full: write small file in single system call, reread to verify
  sm-seq-block: write small file one block at a time, reread to verify
  sm-seq-random: write small file a random amount at a time, reread to verify
  sm-random: write small file randomly, reread randomly to verify
Score: /5

Large files (>= 63 kB)
  lg-create: create large file, verify initialization to zeros
  lg-full: write large file in single system call, reread to verify
  lg-seq-block: write large file one block at a time, reread to verify
  lg-seq-random: write large file a random amount at a time, reread to verify
  lg-random: write large file randomly, reread randomly to verify
Score: /

File growth
  grow-create: create empty file, verify
  grow-seq-sm: extend empty file sequentially to small size, verify
  grow-seq-lg: extend empty file sequentially to large size, verify
  grow-file-size: filesize must return proper value as file grows
  grow-tell: tell must return proper value as file grows
  grow-sparse: create empty file, seek past 64 kB, write byte, verify zeroing
  grow-too-big: create empty file, seek past 2 GB, write byte, must not crash
  grow-root-sm: create 20 small files in root directory
  grow-root-lg: create 50 small files in root directory
  grow-dir-lg: create subdirectory, create 50 small files in it
  grow-two-files: growing two files alternately must work
Score: /

Subdirectories and file management
  dir-mkdir: mkdir a, create a/b, chdir a, open b
  dir-rmdir: create directory, remove directory, chdir into it must now fail
  dir-mk-vine: create deep chain of directories, create & check files in them
  dir-rm-vine: create and remove deep chain of directories
  dir-mk-tree: create wide, deep directory tree, create & check files in it
  dir-rm-tree: create and remove wide, deep directory tree
  dir-lsdir: lsdir must work
  dir-rm-cwd: removing current directory must not crash
  dir-rm-cwd-cd: if current directory removable, then cd'ing to it must fail
  dir-rm-parent: removing current directory and then its parent must not crash
  dir-rm-root: must not be able to remove root directory
  dir-over-file: creating a directory named after an existing file must fail
  dir-under-file: creating a file named after an existing directory must fail
  dir-empty-name: creating a file named after the empty string must fail
  dir-open: if directories can be opened as files, then writing them must fail
Score: /

Synchronization
  syn-remove: read and write deleted file
  syn-read: one process writes file then many read it
  syn-write: many processes write different parts of file, then verify
  syn-rw: one process extends file sequentially as many read it sequentially
