  -4 mmap-read: use mmap to read a file, munmap
  -1 mmap-close: use mmap, close file, read from mapping, munmap
  -1 mmap-unmap: after munmap virtual memory area should be invalid
  -1 mmap-overlap: try to mmap files in overlapping virtual memory areas
  -2 mmap-twice: mmap'ing same file twice should work
  -4 mmap-write: after mmap-modify-munmap a read should reflect changes
