DESIGN [[/40]]
--------------

 -20 Missing or far too brief DESIGNDOC
  -2 Changing interfaces, each (max -6)

DESIGNDOC (per problem):
  -1 Minor details missing
  -2 Major details missing
  -5 Totally missing

Overall:
  -1 Gratuitous use of malloc() (e.g. for allocating a list or a lock)
  -1 Inappropriate use of ASSERT (e.g. to verify that malloc() succeeded)

Problem 1-1: Alarm Clock
  -1 Uses lock/interrupt disabling without justifying
  -1 Uses a lock within interrupt handler
  -3 Busy waiting
  -2 Wakes up too often, e.g. by using semaphores with negative values
  -1 Traverses entire list of sleeping threads every tick
  -1 Doesn't protect data structure in timer_interrupt
  -1 Doesn't protect data structure in timer_sleep
  -3 Bad design

Problem 1-2: Join
  -3 Busy waiting in thread finish when waiting on the parent's join
  -3 A static list of all parent-child pairs is extremely wasteful
  -3 Obviously wasteful with memory (not deleting threads)
  -2 Finished parent deletes children which may still be running
  -1 Enable/disable interrupts
  -2 Joinable child lets its struct thread be deleted before parent dies
  -1 Race condition between join and thread exit

Problem 1-3: Priority Scheduler
  -3 Doesn't use sorted queue scheduler, and don't justify why they didn't
  -2 sema_up() doesn't pick highest-priority waiting thread
  -1 Should use sorted queue in semaphores, unless explained in DESIGNDOC
  -1 cond_signal() doesn't pick highest-priority waiting thread
  -1 Should use sorted queue in conditions, unless explained in DESIGNDOC
  -2 Yield should pick the highest-priority thread (including current)
  -3 Bad design
  +2 Used a heap or other advanced priority queue for ready_list

Problem 1-4: Advanced Scheduler
  -2 Isn't table-driven
  -5 Bad design


STYLE [[/10]]
-------------
  -1 No attempt to conform to existing coding style
