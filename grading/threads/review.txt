DESIGN [[/40]
-------------

 -20 Missing or far too brief DESIGNDOC
  -2 Troublesome or unexplained dependencies
  -2 Changing interfaces, each (max -6)

DESIGNDOC (per problem):
  -1 Minor details missing
  -2 Major details missing
  -5 Totally missing

Problem 1-1: Alarm Clock
  -1 Uses lock/interrupt disabling without justifying
  -1 Uses a lock inside of CallBack
  -3 Busy waiting
  -2 Wakes up too often, e.g. by using semaphores with negative values
  -1 Traverses entire list of sleeping threads every tick
  -1 Put threads to sleep directly
  -1 Doesn't protect data structure in CallBack
  -1 Doesn't protect data structure in WaitUntil
  -3 Bad design

Problem 1-2: Join
  -3 Busy waiting in thread finish when waiting on the parent's join
  -3 A static list of all parent-child pairs is extremely wasteful
  -3 Obviously wasteful with memory (not deleting threads)
  -2 Finished parent deletes children which may still be running
  -1 Enable/disable interrupts or put thread to sleep directly
  -2 Joinable child lets its Thread object be deleted before parent dies
  -1 Race condition between join and thread exit

Problem 1-3: Priority Scheduler
  -3 Doesn't use sorted queue scheduler, and don't justify why they didn't
  -1 Semaphores don't wake highest-priority thread first
  -1 Condition variables don't wake highest-priority thread first
  -1 Should use sorted queue in semaphores, unless explained in DESIGNDOC
  -1 Should use sorted queue in conditions, unless explained in DESIGNDOC
  -2 Yield should pick the highest-priority thread (including current)
  -3 Bad design
  +2 Used a heap or other advanced priority queue for ready_list

Problem 1-4: Advanced Scheduler
  -2 Isn't table-driven
  -5 Bad design


TESTCASES [[/10]
----------------
  -2 Problem 1-1: no test cases/no test output/no description in TESTCASES
  -1 Problem 1-1: not enough testing/inconclusive test output
  -2 Problem 1-2: no test cases/no test output/no description in TESTCASES
  -1 Problem 1-2: not enough testing/inconclusive test output
  -2 Problem 1-3: no test cases/no test output/no description in TESTCASES
  -1 Problem 1-3: not enough testing/inconclusive test output
  -2 Problem 1-4: no test cases/no test output/no description in TESTCASES
  -1 Problem 1-4: not enough testing/inconclusive test output
