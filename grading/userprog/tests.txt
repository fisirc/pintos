        Multiprogramming: Exec'ing two simple programs                  -30
                          from another program doesn't work
        Open/Create fails on page boundary                              -5
        Read/Write fails on page boundary                               -5
        Can close file opened by parent                                 -5
        Running out of physical memory crashes OS                       -5
        Shell test doesn't work with normal page size                   -5
        Shell test doesn't work with smaller page size                  -5
        Exec/Join tests 0 and 1 fail when we substitute a new
        bitmap.cc that returns pages in a random order.                 -5

-----------
Notes on the shell tests :

Large page size echo/matmult test
  -5 if nothing works no matter what you do
  -4 if shell works in either case but matmult doesn't work in either case

Small page size echo/matmult test
  -5 if nothing works no matter what you do
  -4 if shell works in either case but matmult doesn't work in either case
